## 📌 Overview

This project proposes a structured, scenario-based **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) Methodology (OSM)** designed to enhance the **reconnaissance phase** of penetration testing.

While OSINT is commonly used in cybersecurity, it is often performed in an unstructured and inefficient way. This research aimed to create a **methodical and scenario-driven approach** that could help ethical hackers gather more accurate and actionable intelligence during early-stage engagements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🛠️ Develop a structured, branching OSM using the [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/)
- 📋 Validate it with feedback from OSINT professionals via Jisc Online Surveys
- 🔍 Compare its performance against the **Pastor-Galindo et al. (2020) Framework (PGF)**
- 🧪 Test using a real-world missing person case scenario

---

## 🔬 Methodology

- 🧱 Built using Lucidchart with multiple entry points and pivot paths
- 💬 Feedback collected from OSINT professionals via LinkedIn & JISC
- 🧾 Compared OSM vs PGF by investigating a real missing person case
- 🔍 Used passive and semi-passive techniques as per PTES standards

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- ✅ **Scenario-based OSM** gathered **more relevant intelligence** than PGF in targeted investigations
- 🚀 Suitable for **beginner to intermediate** OSINT analysts
- 📚 Valuable as a **teaching tool or starting framework**

---

## 🧠 Expert Feedback (Summary)

✔️ **Strengths**:
- Logical branching and pivot points  
- Clear entry paths (e.g., license plate, email, social handle)  
- Broad intelligence coverage  

⚠️ **Areas to Improve**:
- Lack of interactivity (static Lucidchart format)  
- No real-time feedback or tool integration  
- Mixed views on multi-entry-point structure  
- Needs dynamic UI/UX for better scalability

---

## 🧭 Future Improvements

- 🌐 Convert the static flowchart into an **interactive web app**
- 🌍 Include **country-specific** tools and legal context
- 📉 Add **confidence scoring**, **risk levels**, and **tool suggestions**
- 🔄 Develop multiple **scenario-specific playbooks** (e.g., missing person, insider threat, CEO data leak)
